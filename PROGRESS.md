# Project Progress Log

## Step 1 – Project Setup
- Backend FastAPI scaffold created in `backend/app/main.py`; health and root routes respond.
- Backend virtual environment bootstrapped with `backend/.venv`; requirements installed successfully.
- Frontend React/Vite scaffold created (`frontend/src/App.jsx`, `frontend/src/main.jsx`); dev server confirmed with HTTP 200.
- Infrastructure placeholders added (`infra/docker-compose.yml`) tying backend, frontend, and Postgres; database folder seeded for future migrations.

## Step 2 – Frontend Pages
- Installed `react-router-dom` and introduced layout routing via `frontend/src/components/MainLayout.jsx`.
- Added placeholder content for nine core pages under `frontend/src/pages` (Landing, Auth, Dashboard, Brokers, Quick Trade, Option Chain, Strategies, Risk, Admin) plus a 404 fallback.
- Refreshed styling in `frontend/src/App.css` to support navigation shell and landing marketing sections.
- Verified `npm run build` succeeds, producing production-ready assets in `frontend/dist`.

Next action: Proceed to Step 3 (Frontend Components) after review of Step 2 placeholders.

## Step 3 – Frontend Components
- Introduced reusable components (`DataTable`, `StatCard`, `OptionChainTable`, `QuickTradeButtons`, `OrderTicket`, `NotificationBanner`, `Loader`) under `frontend/src/components/`.
- Wired components into dashboard, broker, quick trade, option chain, strategies, risk, and admin pages with representative placeholder data.
- Extended styling in `frontend/src/App.css` to support tables, cards, order ticket, and notifications.
- Verified `npm run build` after integration to ensure component library compiles cleanly.

Next action: Transition to Step 4 (Backend APIs) once frontend placeholders receive sign-off.

## Step 4 – Backend APIs
- Reorganised `backend/app` into modular packages (core config, security, schemas, services, routers) to avoid monolithic files.
- Implemented in-memory auth and user routes with Pydantic schemas and JWT issuance (`/api/auth/*`, `/api/users/*`).
- Added placeholder routers for brokers, orders, positions, strategies, RMS, analytics, subscriptions, and admin endpoints.
- Confirmed backend boots via `uvicorn` and exercises register/login flow plus OpenAPI exposure.

Next action: Begin Step 5 (Database Schema) to replace in-memory services with persistent storage.

## Step 5 - Database Schema
- Added database configuration and session helpers (`backend/app/core/config.py`, `backend/app/db/session.py`) plus declarative base in `backend/app/db/base.py`.
- Modelled core entities (users, workspaces, brokers, accounts, orders, trades, positions, strategies, RMS rules, subscriptions, logs) under `backend/app/models/` with relationships and enums aligned to the DPR spec.
- Wired Alembic environment (`db/migrations/env.py`, `db/migrations/script.py.mako`) and generated baseline migration `5e470f33fbe2_create_core_tables.py`; applied it against a local SQLite URL to validate metadata until Postgres is available.

Next action: Step 6 (Broker Integrations) will replace in-memory services with adapter scaffolds and begin wiring to the new ORM.
## Step 6 - Broker Integrations
- Established a broker adapter layer with a shared contract and mock adapters for Angel One, Zerodha, Fyers, Dhan, and a Paper Trading simulator under `backend/app/broker_adapters/`.
- Introduced `BrokerService` to drive broker session management, persist accounts, and record orders via the ORM while normalizing adapter responses.
- Replaced the in-memory user flow with the database-backed `UserService`, updating auth/users routers and dependency wiring to leverage SQLAlchemy models.
- Exposed broker and order APIs (`/api/brokers`, `/api/orders`) with new Pydantic schemas that route requests through the adapter layer for connect, refresh, list, and cancel flows.

Next action: Step 7 (Strategy Engine) will use the persisted order state to drive strategy orchestration.
## Step 7 - Strategy Engine
- Added runtime tracking models (`strategy_runs`, `strategy_logs`) with Alembic migration to capture mode, status, and telemetry for each strategy execution.
- Implemented `StrategyService` plus API endpoints for CRUD, start/stop, logs, and PnL analytics, wiring them through FastAPI dependencies.
- Introduced strategy schemas covering run metadata, log retrieval, and aggregated performance shaping the `/api/strategies` contract.
- Stubbed a run lifecycle with logging and simulated metrics, ready for future background workers or signal connectors to plug into the execution flow.

Next action: Step 8 (Risk Management) will integrate RMS guardrails against active strategies and broker positions.
## Step 8 - Risk Management
- Expanded RMS rules to capture daily loss, lot limits, exposure caps, and margin buffers with corresponding Alembic migration.
- Implemented `RmsService` to manage configurations, compute real-time status metrics, and enforce pre-trade guardrails across broker order flow.
- Replaced the risk router with authenticated `/api/rms/*` endpoints for config CRUD, status insight, and square-off requests.
- Wired RMS violations into order placement, returning structured error codes when trades breach configured thresholds.

Next action: Step 9 (Database & Analytics) will build on the enriched trade telemetry for reporting dashboards and audit trails.
## Step 9 - Analytics & Reporting
- Added analytics schemas and service utilities to compute dashboard summaries, daily PnL series, strategy performance, and open exposure snapshots from existing trade data.
- Implemented `/api/analytics/*` endpoints for dashboard aggregation, daily series, strategy tables, recent trades, and live positions with user authentication enforced.
- Wired analytics service into FastAPI dependencies, enabling other routers to reuse aggregated telemetry as needed.
- Ensured compilation success across analytics modules to keep the backend build healthy.

Next action: Step 10 (Infra & DevOps) will operationalize the platform with deployment, observability, and security automation.
## Step 10 - Infra, DevOps & Security
- Expanded docker-compose stack with worker, Redis, Prometheus, and Grafana services plus a placeholder background worker entrypoint for local observability.
- Added Kubernetes base manifests (namespace, config, secrets, deployments, stateful database, ingress) to bootstrap staging clusters.
- Introduced monitoring configuration files and Grafana provisioning along with a sample `.env` for backend settings.
- Wired a GitHub Actions CI workflow to lint/build backend and frontend images while compiling backend modules.

Next action: Step 11 (Roadmap & Phases) will consolidate milestones and outline future delivery tracks.
## Step 11 - Roadmap & Phases
- Reviewed the multi-phase delivery plan, aligning Phase 1–3 objectives with the completed backend/frontend scaffolding.
- Added execution timeline and readiness checklist to `12_roadmap_phases.md` to guide milestone planning and governance.
- Captured outstanding operational items (ownership, KPIs, cadence) as pre-kickoff tasks for the go-to-market rollout.

Project scaffold complete. Ready to transition from planning to implementation.
## Phase 1 Execution - Backend Validation
- Applied Alembic migrations against the shared dev database and seeded a default owner account (`owner@example.com`).
- Added automation scripts under `scripts/` to run health checks, broker/order flows, and strategy lifecycle smoke tests using the in-memory paper broker.
- Hardened eager-load handling in broker/strategy services and confirmed `/api/brokers`, `/api/orders`, and `/api/strategies` operate end-to-end in the Phase 1 scenario.

Next action: Extend frontend integration and end-to-end UI verification against the seeded backend environment.
- Wired frontend pages (Dashboard, Brokers, Quick Trade, Strategies, RMS) to the live FastAPI endpoints with a reusable API client, real-time fetch states, and refreshed styling for forms and tables.
- Added utility scripts documentation plus Vite build now reflects production-ready UI pulling analytics, broker data, orders, and strategy runs from the backend.

Next action: Run through the frontend flows manually and extend integration tests or storybook snapshots as needed.
- Documented a Phase 1 validation playbook (`docs/phase1_validation.md`) covering backend/frontend startup, smoke scripts, and manual UI checks.
- Added PowerShell helpers (`scripts/start_backend.ps1`, `scripts/start_frontend.ps1`) to streamline daily dev startup.
- Implemented frontend authentication (context, API headers, login/register UI) and protected navigation for Phase 1 hotswapping between demo accounts and secured routes.
- Delivered production-ready landing page content pulled from `landing.md`, wiring it into `Landing.jsx` with improved styling and CTA links.
- Elevated the landing experience with media-rich hero and feature sections, professional layout, and dynamic CTA structure sourced from `landing.md`.
- Drafted Phase 2 execution plan (`docs/phase2_plan.md`) covering multi-account execution, advanced analytics, strategy automation, RMS upgrades, and infra milestones.
## Phase 2 - Multi-Account Execution (in progress)
- Added execution registry domain (groups, account allocation policies, execution runs) with migrations and SQLAlchemy models.
- Introduced `AccountRegistryService`, Pydantic schemas, and `/api/execution-groups` endpoints for CRUD + account wiring.
- Upgraded dependency wiring and service exports to support downstream fan-out orchestration.
- Implemented execution allocation preview endpoint and algorithms for proportional, fixed, and weighted policies under /api/execution-groups.
- Wired `BrokerService.place_execution_group_order` to fan-out orders transactionally across mapped accounts with RMS safeguards and `execution_runs` telemetry.
- Published `/api/execution-groups/{group_id}/orders` to return allocation breakdown, resulting child orders, and run identifiers for downstream dashboards.
- Enhanced Quick Trade UI with execution group selectors, allocation preview, and multi-account submission wired to the new fan-out APIs.
- Exposed an Execution Groups workspace (CRUD, account policies) with navigation entry and API integrations for account mapping maintenance.
- Added execution run history endpoint and registry helpers to surface normalized fan-out payloads for each group.
- Displayed recent execution runs in the Execution Groups UI with refresh controls, status formatting, and summary tables for lots, orders, and accounts.
- Captured per-order execution events with latency metrics, persisted via new `execution_run_events` and exposed at `/api/execution-groups/{group_id}/runs/{run_id}/events` for UI traceability.
- Surfaced execution telemetry in analytics summaries and dashboard stat cards, including total runs, failure counts, and average execution latency.
- Implemented analytics service, router, and dependency wiring to expose consolidated dashboard metrics, PnL series, strategy stats, and trade snapshots under /api/analytics/*.
- Added analytics schemas and SQL aggregation queries to surface realized/unrealized PnL, execution run counts, failure totals, and latency averages sourced from execution events.
- Updated the dashboard API client and UI to consume analytics endpoints with formatted stat cards, tables, and loading/error states tied to live telemetry.
- Enriched execution run payloads with per-leg outcome snapshots and percentile latency statistics, returning structured leg telemetry in broker responses and analytics summaries.
- Surfaced latency percentiles and leg status aggregates on the dashboard alongside execution group tables, highlighting per-order metadata for troubleshooting.
- Automated Alembic migrations inside `scripts/start_backend.ps1` so local starts keep the SQLite schema aligned without manual intervention.
- Introduced prototype analytics visualisations (sparkline, heatmap, percentile bars) and an insights workspace to preview Phase 2 reporting needs.

- Added auto-refresh timers to dashboard and analytics insights views to keep telemetry current without manual reloads.
- Exposed CSV/JSON export endpoints for daily PnL, latency summaries, and leg statuses; wired UI download buttons with auth-aware fetch.
- Introduced heatmap/sparkline/bar chart components plus styling to visualise Phase 2 analytics prototypes in the new Insights workspace.

- Added `.env.example` to standardise Postgres configuration and documented docker/local setup in `docs/postgres_setup.md`.
- Updated backend start script guidance so migrations target Postgres automatically when `DATABASE_URL` is supplied.
- Scaffolded `/api/webhooks` endpoints with an in-memory connector service and event ingestion hook as the base for strategy automation.
- Migrated the strategy scheduler to a database-backed service with cron validation, REST endpoints, and job context storage.
- Hooked webhook events into the scheduler service, persisting job context and triggering the strategy dispatcher stub for future automation.

Next action: Connect Celery-dispatched jobs to real strategy execution and persist run metrics for analytics/Timescale.

- Connected Celery-dispatched strategy jobs to persist run metrics and mark completion via StrategyService.record_run_metrics in ackend/app/tasks/strategy.py; dispatcher now returns run id for downstream processing. Next: wire real execution logic and link ExecutionRuns to runs for detailed analytics.
- Wired Celery strategy runs to execution-group orders; dispatcher triggers broker fan-out, links ExecutionRuns to StrategyRun IDs, and records latency/allocation metrics for analytics dashboards.
- Implemented StrategyRunner executing paper/live runs via execution groups and backtest simulations; Celery task now logs run events and records metrics/logs through StrategyService for analytics-ready telemetry.
- Webhook ingestion now auto-triggers strategy runs via scheduler.trigger_job, closing the loop between external signals and the execution pipeline.
- Enhanced strategies UI to surface live run telemetry, performance stats, and recent logs using new StrategyRunner outputs for rapid validation of automation flows.
- Added StrategyRunner integration tests exercising paper/live fan-out and backtest simulation flows to guard metrics/log output; backend pytest suite passes (`pytest tests/test_strategy_runner.py`).
