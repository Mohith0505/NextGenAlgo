## How it works (3 steps)

1. **Link your brokers**  
   Secure OAuth/TOTP flow. See margins, positions & health in one place.

2. **Choose your input**  
   - Manual trading (Quick Trade Panel)  
   - Built-in or custom strategies (Backtest/Paper/Live)  
   - External signals via webhooks (TradingView/Amibroker/MT4/MT5/Excel)

3. **Trade with guardrails**  
   Every order passes RMS checks (max lots, margin, daily loss, circuit bands). Violations auto-block or square-off — with instant alerts.

## FAQ

**Is it web-based or do I need a VPS?**  
100% web-based. No desktop installs. (You can still deploy privately via Docker/K8s if you prefer.)

**Which brokers are supported?**  
Major Indian brokers and API-first platforms via adapters. Add your accounts from the Brokers page.

**Can I automate TradingView/Amibroker/MT4/5/Excel signals?**  
Yes — send webhook/bridge signals and map them to strategies and accounts.

**How do you keep me safe?**  
RMS blocks non-conforming orders, enforces daily loss caps, and can auto square-off at your set time. Full audit trail is available.

**Do you offer paper trading?**  
Yes. Backtest → Paper → Live share the same engine so your logic behaves consistently.
